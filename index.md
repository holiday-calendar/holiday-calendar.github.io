## Welcome to the Holiday Calendar Project

The Holiday Calendar Project is an open source effort to provide reliable,
reusable libraries for defining and calculating the various holiday calendars
around the world. Holiday date calculation is one of the oldest types of
complex computation, and the goal of this project is to provide correct holiday
dates for all use cases in a multitude of popular programming languages.

### Holiday Calendars

For every supported programming language, the `holiday-calendar-*` libraries
will provide these calendars:

* Australian national holidays
* Major African national holidays
* Major Asian national holidays
* Major European national holidays
* Major North American national holidays
* Major South American national holidays
* World financial & central bank holidays
